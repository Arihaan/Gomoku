# Gomoku
A Python implementation of the Japanese strategy game Gomoku.

The GUI is developed using the pre-installed library Tkinter and hence, does not require any additional modules.

Download and run gomoku.py to play the game. The look of the game may vary across devices, it is advised to change the height of the window as required, either by dragging the bottom of the window after running gomoku.py or by changing the variable "height_val" on line 7 of the code.

Developed as part of the Programming 1 course at Charles University, Prague. Tested on macOS Monterey, Windows 10 and Kali.

Expected interface:
